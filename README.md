# Huffman-Coding-Compression-Tool

Project completed 2/8. Backed up to GitHub 3/26.

About

This project contains two main programs hencode and hdecode.


hencode

This program uses the Huffman coding algorithm to compress a text file. Text files are compressed by building a Huffman tree based on frequencies of characters and extracting the 
new bit codes into the compressed file.


hdecode

This program reverses the compression of a file that was compressed using Huffman encoding. Reversal is done by regenerating the original Huffman tree. Simultaneous traversal of the tree and writing of the original characters occurs.
